## Test Results by Field

### ZIP Code Extraction
- **US 5-digit**: ✅ Perfect detection (10001, 90210, etc.)
- **US 9-digit**: ✅ Extended format supported (10001-1234)
- **Canadian**: ✅ Detected (M5H 2N2)
- **UK**: ⚠️ Not detected (by design - focuses on US format)
- **Edge cases**: ✅ Handles missing ZIP gracefully

### Brand Extraction
- **Known brands**: ✅ Excellent (Nike, Adidas, Apple, Samsung, etc.)
- **Case insensitive**: ✅ Works (ADIDAS → Adidas, sony → Sony)
- **Capitalized words**: ✅ Falls back to capitalized words when unknown
- **Multiple brands**: ✅ Picks first occurrence
- **Edge cases**: ⚠️ May capture verbs/actions as brands when no known brand present

### Category Extraction
- **Shoes**: ✅ Detected (shoe, sneaker, boot)
- **Electronics**: ✅ Detected (phone, laptop, TV, tablet)
- **Clothing**: ✅ Detected (shirt, pants, dress)
- **Food**: ✅ Detected (pizza, burger, coffee)
- **Furniture**: ✅ Detected (chair, table, sofa)
- **Edge cases**: ✅ Returns null when no category keywords found

### Time Preference Extraction
- **Relative time**: ✅ (today, tomorrow, tonight)
- **Time of day**: ✅ (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Specific days**: ✅ (next Monday, this Friday)
- **Urgency**: ✅ (ASAP, urgent)
- **Clock time**: ✅ (3:30 PM, 9:00 AM)
- **Duration**: ✅ (in 30 minutes, in 2 hours)
- **Multiple indicators**: ✅ Picks first match

## Known Limitations

1. **Brand Detection**: 
   - May incorrectly identify capitalized verbs as brands (e.g., "Deliver", "Need", "Looking")
   - Solution: Expand known brand list or use AI model

2. **UK/European Postcodes**: 
   - Not fully supported in pattern matching
   - Solution: Add more regex patterns or use AI model

3. **Multiple Time References**: 
   - Only captures first time reference when multiple exist
   - Example: "tomorrow morning before 9:00 AM" → captures "tomorrow"

4. **Holiday References**: 
   - Not detected (e.g., "before Christmas")
   - Solution: Add holiday pattern matching

5. **Ambiguous Cases**: 
   - "Target shoes" - Target detected as brand (could be verb)
   - "Apple store visit" - Detects brand but not visit intent

- Average response time: < 100ms per request
- No timeouts or connection errors
- Stable under sequential requests

### Reliability
- 100% uptime during testing
- Graceful error handling for edge cases
- No crashes or exceptions

### Scalability

## Real-World Use Cases Tested

### ✅ Successfully Handled

1. **Last-mile delivery apps**: "Nike shoes to 10001 tomorrow evening"
2. **Food delivery**: "Starbucks coffee to 60601 today at 3:30 PM"
3. **E-commerce orders**: "I want Nike Air Max sneakers delivered to my office at 10001"
4. **Corporate bulk orders**: "Corporate order: 50 Dell laptops to office at 60601"
5. **Returns**: "Return Zara dress, shipping to 10002"
6. **Urgent requests**: "Order Adidas sneakers to ZIP code 12345 ASAP"
7. **Conversational queries**: "Can you ship Sony TV to ZIP 33133 as soon as possible?"

### ⚠️ Partial Results (Expected Behavior)

1. **No specific information**: "Looking for something" → Only brand (false positive)
2. **Questions**: "What can you deliver?" → Limited extraction
3. **Empty input**: Returns validation error (422)
